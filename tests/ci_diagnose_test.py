"""Corpus for the CI diagnostician.

Two properties matter more than the matching itself:

  - It must NEVER claim a cause it does not have. A confident wrong diagnosis
    sends someone down the wrong path, which is worse than "unknown".
  - It must NEVER leak a secret. CI logs are full of them, and this tool's whole
    job is to forward log excerpts to a model and a chat channel.
