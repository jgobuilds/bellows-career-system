"""Diagnose a failed CI run. ADVISE ONLY — it never changes anything.

WHY IT CANNOT FIX. The obvious version of this tool commits a fix and pushes.
Look at what CI actually failed on recently: a gate that was too strict, a check
whose regex was wrong, a token form. The cheapest way to make CI green is almost
always to WEAKEN A CHECK — so an agent rewarded for green output learns to file
down the safety net, and it does it at 3am with nobody reading. This tool
therefore has no write path at all, not merely a disabled one.

THE LOOP — deterministic work before expensive work, applied to CI:

    deterministic  ->  model  ->  human
    known cause        hypothesis   decide

  1. DETERMINISTIC. The known-cause tables are matched first. A hit costs
     nothing, cannot hallucinate, and is the same answer every time. This is
     where confirmed fixes get PROMOTED to: diagnosing a new failure ends with
     adding a row, so the second occurrence is free.

  2. MODEL, only for what the tables miss. The log is REDACTED first (below).
     This step BUILDS a payload; it does not send one. Where a control plane
     exists the payload goes through it — tiered, budgeted, and written to an
     audit ledger — rather than straight to a provider.

  3. HUMAN. The model proposes; a person decides. With ask_human wired, an
     uncertain diagnosis can ask rather than guess.
